/// The tables stay declared in the actor body: they are the application's own
/// persistent state, and the same table `Expose` reads is the one written here.
/// Records share their mutable parts by reference, so the mixin holds nothing that
/// must survive an upgrade.
///
/// Idempotency without stored progress: every upload states the position it expects
/// the table to be at and traps if the table disagrees, so a retried ingress message
/// fails loudly instead of loading rows twice, and a producer that lost track
/// resynchronises with `rows`. One target's segments must therefore arrive in order;
/// separate targets are independent.
///
/// Two ways to get an index. A `#hash` index built off-chain arrives with the data
/// as index segments (`putIndexChunk`/`commitIndex`) and serves from the first query
/// after the segments tile the loaded rows. Anything else — a column the producer did
/// not index, a composite, `#ordered` — is built on-chain by `buildIndex`: the decl
/// registers pending so queries scan (a correct superset), a self-rescheduling timer
/// walks the store in bounded chunks, and the index serves once the walk completes.
/// An upgrade drops the timer, not the decl; call `buildIndex` again, the walk is
/// idempotent. `Table.loadSegment` refuses a table that already declares an index,
/// rather than let a ready index silently miss every loaded row.
///
/// LOADING MORE DATA LATER is a DELTA upload — new data segments plus index segments
/// covering only the new rows, never the whole index again. The order is:
///
///   1. `reopenIndex(name, col)` for EVERY region-indexed column. Each goes back to
///      pending and drops its heap decl, which is what re-satisfies the load gate
///      above; a column left ready keeps the gate shut, so a partial reopen fails
///      loudly rather than leaving a base that misses the new rows.
///   2. `putSegment` the new data, as on a first load, resuming from `rows(name)`.
///   3. Per column, `putIndexChunk`/`commitIndex` segments starting at
///      `indexCoverage(name, col)` — which still answers while reopened, and is
///      already the row the extension must continue from — until they reach
///      `rows(name)`, at which point the column serves again.
///
/// A reopened column keeps answering throughout: its base still covers `[0,
/// indexCoverage)` and serves that prefix, and only the rows past it are scanned, so
/// the cost is the UNCOVERED TAIL rather than the table. The two ranges are disjoint,
/// so nothing is counted twice.
///
/// What it stops taking is ordinary WRITES. `Table.append` traps between step 1 and
/// the commit that ends step 3, so a segment is the only way a position can enter.
/// Symmetrically, `reopenIndex` refuses a table whose rows arrived by `append` after
/// the index went ready, and `putSegment` refuses a table holding any appended row at
/// all — the producer's file cursor and the table's positions have drifted, and
/// loading on would index rows at positions they do not occupy.
